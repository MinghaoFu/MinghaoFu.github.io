I am a first-year master student at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), advised by [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html). I work closely with [Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/).

My current research interests include: Causal Discovery, Causal Represenational Learning, and ML for science/healthcare. 

See my [CV](../files/Academic_CV.pdf) for more details.
